          Hello My Name is Hugo Garcia. I was born in Paris. I was fortunate enough to have lived in numerous countries such as Vietnam, Singapore, Scotland and South Africa. In addition to that I enjoy vising new places and countries everywhere in the world. At the moment I am currently living in Cergy, next to Paris were I'm studying a degree in Business Administration here at Essec.

      <h2>Rugby</h2>
      <p>
       I'm currently a player at Essec Rugby Team and have been playing the sports for 9 years now, I thoroughly enjoy it and will never get bored of it. I have played rugby in many different countries and clubs including recently Racing 92 next to Paris where I have played for a yeard and a half. I have met some lifelong friends and built some amazing relationships thanks to this sport and it has contributed a lot to the person I am today.

        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>
         Thanks to my numerous international experiences, today I love travelling, discovering new cultures, meeting new people, and I think it is today a trong part of my identity and mentality. I enjoy interacting with international people in order to learn from them and their respective different cultures and Essec has given me the opportunity to do so. During the holidays I enjoy going on hikes with my friends around Europe as I think it is an extremely healthy and valuable activity to be doing, last year for example we went with two friends of mine in Spain and Italy for two weeks and it was fantastic.

    <h2>Finance, Internships</h2>
        <p>
           In order to validate our first year as an undergraduate student at ESSEC, the administration asks us to do a summer internship for a period of 3 to 4 months, and I am going to do my internship in an Investment Bank as a corporate credit summer analyst.  I will be working in the Institutional Institutions, in London, for 4 months. I am really looking forward to start working, especially in the field of finance which I really enjoy! It will be a great experience

    <h2>Additional Information, Future ambitions</h2>
        <p>
          I believe sports have contributed a lot to my personal growth and character. They've increased my self-esteem, improved my social skills and leadership abilities, my resilience and developed a positive attitude towards hard moments. As my last point, I'll also mention the fact that attending Finance and Accounting classes here at Essec have motivated me and got spiked my interest in that specific field of work and that I one day intend on making a career out of it.
